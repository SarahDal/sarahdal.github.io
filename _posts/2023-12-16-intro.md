Hello! I'm Sarah, I'm a coastal ecologist specialising in seabirds (particularly large gulls, like Herring and Lesser Black-backed gulls) with an interest in tech, small board computers, coding, drones, and GIS. I've had an online presence since the 1990s, and as current social media seems to be dragging everything along, I've been enjoying opting out of twitter/facebook/etc, and getting back into rolling my own webpage, or at least trying to.

Currently you can find me on mastodon at @sarahdalgulls@ecoevo.social
