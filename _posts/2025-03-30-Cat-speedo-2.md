Previously I tried to write about how to set up a speedometer for a cat wheel using an ESP32, hall sensor and some magnets. I have now found a much easier way to get the speed into [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) via [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/). If you use Home Assistant but don't already use ESPhome, it's an incredibly brilliant and simple way to get DIY devices made with ESP32 boards into Home Assistant.

As the cat wheel speedo runs on an ESP32, I realised that there's probably a way to use ESPhome to do this. At first I attempted to get speed by using automations and helpers to try and calculate the speed by keeping a tally of change-of-state of the hall sensor, but it got ridiculously complicated and didn't work, and then I realised there's a [pulse counter component](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/pulse_counter.html) in ESPHome that will keep track of a count of "pulses per minute", simply registering each time the hall sensor activated as a pulse. This was much, much easier as now I had a speed value I just needed to convert to m/s.

This is the YAML for the ESPHome running on the ESP32 that is attached to the wheel. 4 magnets on the edge of the wheel trigger the hall sensor when they pass, generating a "pulse" that is measured by the pulse counter. My hall sensor is connected to GPIO Pin 14 on the ESP32.

{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: pulse_counter
    pin: GPIO14
    id: wheel_counter
    unit_of_measurement: "m/s"
    name: "Cat Wheel Speed"
    icon: "mdi:mdi-rotate-right"
    update_interval: 1s
    filters:
      - multiply: 0.01167
    total:
      name: "cat wheel revolutions"
      unit_of_measurement: "revs"
```
{% endraw %}


The distance between the magnets is 0.7m, so to convert from "pulses per minute" to "meters per second" I multiply it by 0.01167 (the result of (0.7 / 1 pulse) x (1 minute / 60 seconds)). You can also set the update_interval to whatever you want; ms values would give you a real-time speed which could look good if you then added in a physical display to the speedo too.

Also here is the "total" value, which keeps a tally of the total number of pulses. I thought I could multiply it by 0.7 here and get a total distance travelled, but it's an int and wouldn't store the decimal, so it's just a tally of the total number of times the magnets have triggered the hall sensor. 

Now to add in useful/fun entities, I created the following in Home Assistant's config.yaml:

{% raw %}
```yaml
  - sensor:
    - name: "Cat Wheel Total Distance"        
      unique_id: cat_wheel_distance
      state: >
        '{{ (states('sensor.esp32_cam_cat_wheel_distance') | float * 0.7) | round(2) }}' 
      unit_of_measurement: "m"
      device_class: distance
    - name: "Cat Wheel Daily Distance"        
      unique_id: cat_wheel_day_distance
      state: >
        '{{ (states('sensor.daily_cat_wheel_distance') | float * 0.7) | round(2) }}'
      unit_of_measurement: "m"
      device_class: distance
```
{% endraw %}

Here, I'm calculating a total distance and a daily distance by taking the "cat wheel distance" total and multiplying it by 0.7. It's the same for both sensors, but for one of them is linked to a helper (Settings -> devices & services -> helpers) that resets the value at midnight. 

Also in the helpers section , you can create a Statistics Sensor that gives you the Max value for Cat Wheel Speed, and the time period (eg 1 day, or all time). Or average daily distance? Can you calculate how many calories the cat burns runnign on the wheel? How about rigging up a Home Assistant controlled treat dispenser that issues a dreamie every 50m?
