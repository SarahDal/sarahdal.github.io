Nesting in colonies of tens of thousands, rocky cliffs and islands around the UK hold over half of the world's population of Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus), with the world's largest colony being Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth (75,000 pairs) and the colony on Saint Kilda (60,000 pairs).

Traditionally these huge colonies are counted by aerial photography, and only really need a detailed count about once a decade. With these birds being impacted extremely badly by HPAI in 2022 and 2023, new counts are now being undertaken by drone, which is a lot easier (in theory) and cheaper than paying for dedicated photography from an aircraft. I've never carried out drone photography of cliff nesters so was asked if I'd like to help out with the count at Ailsa Craig, a lump of volcanic rock 16km (10 miles) off the coast of Ayrshire in South West Scotland.

Ailsa Craig is famed for being the source of the finest granite for making Curling Stones. A local company holds the sole licence to quarry here, and takes granite off the island about once a decade, most recently just this winter and youtuber Ruth Aisling made a [fantastically informative video about the whole process](https://youtu.be/lTjOoeR0iFY) so you can watch that rather than me try to explain.

The boat trip is about an hour out of Girvan, and includes a circuit of the island so we could see the dramatic cliffs rising out of the water, covered in nesting seabirds - Gannets are the most obvious, but colonies of guillemots and razorbills, kittiwakes, and fulmar, and on some of the steep grassy slopes, puffins ambling about between their burrows. Tysties (black guillemots) were on the water, although I couldn't spot any on the cliffs.

Dozens of Manx shearwaters flew past the boat as well, presumably these nest on the island now, especially after rats were eradicated in the early 90s, but breeding has yet to be proven. You can read about the first succesful rat eradication in the UK in this [2001 article](https://web.archive.org/web/20220120073100/https://www.ayrshire-birding.org.uk/2001/01/ailsa_craig_before_and_after_the_eradication_of_rats_in_1991/) by Bernie Zofrillo, who led the eradication project.

Once on the island, we pitched our tents by the old gas works. This was where coal gas was generated to power the lighthouse and foghorns until 1911, when the lamp was switched to parafin. The flat part of the island is covered in remains from both the lighthouse and quarrying infrastructure, with a 3-foot gauge rail for the lighthouse still in place, and plenty of tracks and evidence of quarrying. The lighthouse is still operational, and being painted by three workmen when we were on the island.

In the sunshine, we walked from the lighthouse clockwise along the track left by this winter's rock extraction, we passed the south foghorn, on top of a concrete dome and with compressed air cannisters rusting alongside. Huge boulders litter the shore line, we walked as far as "Trammins" and flew the drone to take photographs of the gannets nesting on the 200m high cliffs towering above.

I slept very well in my tent, and we were up at 6 but had to wait for the low cloud to shift and the tide to go out a little before walking anti-clockwise this time, following a trackway that carried the piped gas to power the north foghorn. In places it bridged inlets, these were rusted away so we dropped to the beach then climbed back up the other side.

We also stopped at the remains of the old North Quarry, and puzzled a bit at vast piles of stone with cylinders cut out, and the stone cylinders themselves, before it clicked that these were where they used to cut out the basic curling stone shape before shipping them off the island, presumably easier to do so and ship off here before larger boats and trucks made taking whole boulders off the easiest method.

Tempted to take a "raw" curling stone back with us but a little heavy for our backpack. We walked on, past the northern foghorn, and then through a very low colony of Auks, until we were underneath the main Gannetry on the vast cliffs, and were able to photograph them again with the drone.

The south-west point of Ailsa Craig holds a deep seacave that makes walking a loop of the island impossible, so we walked back the way we came and found we still had a good few hours before the boat. I climbed the incredibly steep and loose path through thick bracken, reaching the Castle (A 16th century tower)

And alongside it, a tanked spring, one of four on the island. (the main source of water for our trip was me knocking at the lighthouse and asking if we could have a bottle of water when we realised we hadn't brought enough)

Through the bracken, I could follow the path a little further, but then lost it int he bracken on the rocky slope. I didn't feel like going any further, so went back to the castle for a sandwich and a chat with a kayaker who had just arrived.

After returning down the hill, I explored the buildings more, and chatted with daytrippers who'd been dropped off. A fast private charter returned - we'd spoken to the skipper last night too, a local man, who'd been coming out the Craig since he was 9 years old. He told some tall tales about the lighthouse keepers, and how the current owner of the old lighthouse buildings - these are seperate ownership to the island - is applying for planning to build 40 glamping pods out here for holidaying, which I don't think anyone thinks is a good idea. I was more dismayed about how the buildings that were still in use (the old lighthouse cottages and the Quarry Manager's Cottage, used by the local ringing group) had been left to collapse. I understand the ringers lacking the funds to maintain their building, but the multi-millionaire who owns the cottages could at least keep them in good condition. The rest of the buildings were little more than atmospheric ruins.
