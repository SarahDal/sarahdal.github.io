Back in 2020, I was inspired to create a low power, low cost livestreaming nature camera that could be relatively easily deployed around the nature reserve.

 You can see if I am currently streaming with this setup [here](/www/picam/)

## The Streaming

For the streaming itself, you can use the excellent [Restreamer](https://docs.datarhei.com/restreamer/getting-started/quick-start). This runs in Docker, and can be a bit fiddly to set up intially, but [PiMyLifeUP have a great guide to the whole setup here](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-restreamer/). Once you've gotten streaming running, there's a couple of options for running a pi remotely..

If you have a power source and ethernet connection within 100m, the easiest is to use a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) connection. Ethernet cable is a much lighter way to run power long distance rather than a mains cable of the same length.

### Hardware:

*   Huawei E3372 or similar 4g dongle
*   4G data sim
*   Pi + pi camera
*   PoE hat with fan
*   Ethernet cable, max 100m
*   60W ethernet injector
*   Watertight case (eg this electrical enclosure) and connector things
*   Drill and bits, small clear plastic to cover the drilled hole for the camera, plus glue to glue the clear plastic tightly over this hole.

This camera uses Power over Ethernet so that you can have a very long power cable that doesn't weigh too much. You could of course use a mains cable, but with PoE you have the option of plugging it into a modem at the mains, or (as I did) use a mobile data dongle and only need a mains supply into the PoE.

To split the PoE at the Pi end, either the Pi needs a PoE Hat, or you can use a simple splitter that splits the PoE into USB power and Ethernet.

Drill a hole for the camera and one on the other side for the cable entry. Then cover this hole with plastic, strongly glued (I used epoxy resin), creating a window for the camera to look out of. The Ethernet Cable will fit through a cable gland size PG7 or M12.

At the mains side of things, techincally a 30W PoE injector should work, but it didn't. 60W worked. The Pi's USB sockets don't have enough power to run a USB 4G wifi modem (such as Huawei E5330, which would have been perfect), but you may find a USB dongle modem, such as a Huawei E3372 will work. The best option for an internet connection is to plug a 4G router with an ethernet port (such as TP-Link Archer modems) into the PoE injector at the mains.

With a USB dongle modem, you won't be able to connect to the Pi over SSH or VNC on the same network from your computer or phone, which is really important to check for any problems and to safely shut down the Pi if you need to. So I set up [remote.it](https://www.remote.it/) to access the Pi over the internet; this is also handy if you want to remotely access the Pi anyway.

## Powering with Solar and a Battery

Hardware:

*   small 4g Wifi USB Modem, such as a Huawei E5330 or Vodafone R216-Z
*   4G data sim
*   [Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) + [pi camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/)
*   [Witty pi power management hat](https://www.uugear.com/product/witty-pi-3-realtime-clock-and-power-management-for-raspberry-pi/)
*   12V Lead Acid Battery, 72Ah
*   70W Solar Panel
*   Solar charge controller with built-in USB socket
*   12V 2-core cable to connect the camera to the solar charge controller
*   Large waterproof box to put the battery and electricals in, eg [Form Skyda 49l](https://www.trade-point.co.uk/departments/form-skyda-black-49l-plastic-storage-trunk/3663602763451_TP.prd)
*   Watertight case (eg [this electrical enclosure](https://www.screwfix.com/p/schneider-electric-ip66-weatherproof-outdoor-enclosure-164-x-105-x-192mm/576hv)) and connector things
*   Drill and bits, small clear plastic to cover the drilled hole for the camera, plus glue to glue the clear plastic tightly over this hole.

This version runs on a solar and battery power. I used a large 72Ah lead battery, which should keep the pi powered even through grey days in the middle of winter. Solar power isn't too complicated, but you might want to read around small off-grid solar systems for more detail, particularly about working out how long you can power things for, and how big a solar panel you need. I worked out 70w was more than enough for me.

The solar panel, battery and the thing you are powering (the load) all plug into a solar charge controller, which monitors and controls the power going from the panel into the battery to prevent damage to the battery and to the thing you are powering.

The Witty Pi hat lets you safely turn the pi on and off with a button, as powering off the Pi without shutting down first can corrupt the SD card. Not only is just presing an off button much easier when you're out in the field trying to set everythign up, the Witty Pi also lets you set a timer for automatically switching on and off every day, so you don't have to leave it running at night when it's too dark to see, saving battery.

Your USB wifi modem can be plugged straight into the charge controller's USB port, but these usb ports don't generally have enough amps to also power the pi. Witty Pi hat solves this problem nicely, as newer version of Witty Pi let you power the Pi directly from 12V. Solder a XH2.54 male connector to one end of your 12V cable to connect it to the Witty Pi, the other end is then put in the solar charge controller Check you have Witty pi 3 v2, else this won't work.(The 12V cable will fit through a cable gland size PG7 or M12.)

For my solar picam, I glued a camera UV filter over the driled hole for the camera to look out of. I fixed the PiCam to a small piece of plastic, and then used self-adhesive plastic stand-off to hold this. This required tiny bolts for the picam (2mm!), and slightly bigger holes for the stand-offs.

If you are near the pi, you can access the pi headerless over the same wifi network. But it's a lot easier to be able to access it from elsewhere, so I used [remote.it](https://www.remote.it/) to access over the internet.

I also used a smaller enclosure (Schneider 138x93x72mm) that the pi just fits into. I had to arrange it carefully because the off switch of the Witty Pi kept pressing against the wall. It looks great though!
