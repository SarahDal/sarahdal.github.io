I'm a coastal ecologist specialising in seabirds (particularly large gulls, like Herring and Lesser Black-backed gulls) with an interest in tech, small board computers, coding, drones, and GIS. I've had an online presence since the 1990s, and now I've been enjoying opting out of centralised social media and getting back into rolling my own webpage. or at least trying to.

You can find me on mastodon at [@sarahdalgulls@ecoevo.social](https://ecoevo.social/@sarahdalgulls/)

I currently live in the north east of England, working with the RSPB on coastal species conservation. Prior to this I worked at the following:
* Shop assistant, several times
* Bar steward, mainly at the excellent Bow Bar in Edinburgh
* Little Tern Warden at Long Nanny, Northumberland (2003)
* Digitisation of the Northumberland County Archives Aquisition Ledgers (2003)
* Biological field assistant, tracking brown bears on the Greek-Albania-North Macedonia border (2004)
* Conducting a baseline survey of cliff nesting seabird productivity on Lundy Island (2006)
* Assistant warden on Skokholm Island (2007)
* Ecological Consultant, for a few years (2008ish - 2012ish)
* Warden of Rockcliffe Marsh (2014)
* Seabird surveys on Saint Kilda (Summer 2015)
* Raptor montioring at Batumi Raptor Count, in the Republic of Georgia (Autumn 2015)
* South Walney Nature Reserve Warden (2015 - 2021)
* Organising and carrying out a county-wide survey of beach nesting Ringed Plover on the Cumbrian Coast (2022)
