Nesting in colonies of tens of thousands, rocky cliffs and islands around the UK hold over half of the world's population of Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus), with the world's largest colony being Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth (75,000 pairs) and the colony on Saint Kilda (60,000 pairs).

Traditionally these huge colonies are counted by aerial photography, and only really need a detailed count about once a decade. With these birds being impacted extremely badly by HPAI in 2022 and 2023, new counts are now being undertaken by drone, which is a lot easier (in theory) and cheaper than paying for dedicated photography from an aircraft. I've never carried out drone photography of cliff nesters so was asked if I'd like to help out with the count at Ailsa Craig, a lump of volcanic rock 16km (10 miles) off the coast of Ayrshire in South West Scotland.

Ailsa Craig is famed for being the source of the finest granite for making Curling Stones. A local company holds the sole licence to quarry here, and takes granite off the island about once a decade, most recently just this winter and youtuber Ruth Aisling made a [fantastically informative video about the whole process](https://youtu.be/lTjOoeR0iFY) so you can watch that rather than me try to explain.
