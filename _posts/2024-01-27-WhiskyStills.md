In upper Coquetdale in the remotest part of Northumberland, evidence still remains of illicit whisky-distilling in the 1700s, supplying illegal drinking dens. Cut off from excise men by the sheer remoteness of the area, shepherds and farmers, as well as cattle-drovers and smugglers heading down from Scotland, drank at unlicenced houses at Slyme-foot and Chew Green along the River Coquet, high in the Cheviot hills. These inns were supplied by illicit stills hidden deep in even more remote tiny valleys, and amazingly there's still evidence of them  on the ground.


The Northumberland National Park comissioned a report into them, which is still [availble here](https://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coquetdalewhiskyresearchreport-2.pdf), that goes into great depth on the history of whisky (and beer) in this area. Otherwise, I couldn't find much online other than [a few pictures on Geograph](https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2541447) so I thought I'd head out for a look.

This area is wonderfully desolate and remote, and after following the Wholehope Burn for about 4km,

I was delighted to come across much more intact ruins of the still than I had expected:

You can still clearly make out the circular area where the "pot" would have sat, boiling away, and there's another small square room joining it. It's easy to imagine the distiller sat out here, tending his pot, or a shepherd stopping by for a couple of drams.

From here, I climbed up Saughy Hill for some typically Northumbrian Views:

And then, because I was also using this walk to practice navigation, I got round the lea of the summit out of the wind and checked against a map to find my way down the other side to a stell on Midhope Burn, near the site of another still:

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any sign of a still along this burn at all, there were some outcrops of rocks but nothing that looked like worked stone. This might have been a more ephemeral still, maybe in a wooden shack?

I followed the burn back down to Batailshiel Haugh, which turned out to be a nice little bungalow. Given that we are about 3 miles up the valley from an already incredibly remote valley, this surely must be one of the most isolated houses in England? Although, given the quality of the track to it, I think it must be military accomodation rather than someone's house. What a spot though.

This was a really great walk, and I even managed to navigate without using a gps and not get horribly lost. I've written up the route on my [OutdoorActive page](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-route/north-east-england/coquetdale-whisky-stills/286115147/), if you are interested.
